# CV

06/15/22

I am creating an online resume as my first project in a few months. I will get reacclimated to working with GitHub, Visual Studio and HTML & CSS. 

The first step was separating the different sections into the containers, and aligning things correctly. I used previous code to jog my memory of how Flexbox, and CSS selectors are used.

My goals for the rest of this project are:

1. Modify the fonts, and organize the headings and subheadings using CSS selectors
2. Use different font families and effects
3. Choose appropriate background colors and font colors
4. Work on borders, padding, margin, spacing
5. Add the CV to my github pages account
