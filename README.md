# CV

06/15/23

I am creating an online resume as my first project in a few months. I will get reacclimated to working with GitHub, Visual Studio and HTML & CSS. 

The first step was separating the different sections into the containers, and aligning things correctly. I used previous code to jog my memory of how Flexbox, and CSS selectors are used.

My goals for the rest of this project are:

1. Modify the fonts, and organize the headings and subheadings using CSS selectors
2. Use different font families and effects
3. Choose appropriate background colors and font colors
4. Work on borders, padding, margin, spacing
5. Add the CV to my github pages account

I've got a better idea of how the site will be laid out. I did some organization of the repository. I also began to use flexbox for the header and some CSS styling on the links. I have also added images and icons to the repository. 

The next step will be picking colors and fonts. Once I settle on something that looks good, then I will begin adding more content to the page, including a write up for the about me section on the home page, and then adding a pdf version of my resume to the CV page.

I sketched out the elements of the home page. Then I divided my sketch in the different divs and did a basic layout. I need to make sure the links are properly spaced in the topnav, and also to resize the images.

This week I made incremental progress, just honing and figuring out how the layout should be, and honing the CSS. I think next up I will focus on fonts and overall design. So far the design is fairly simple, and I am hoping for something that looks a bit more sleek.

Today's work was changing up the design completely. I changed the header, background image, and the colors of each subsection. I also used stackexchange & W3 to learn techniques to fix the header and to have anchor elements link within the page. Instead of having multiple pages, I will place the portfolio and a copy of my CV all on one page.
