        <h2>About Me </h2>
      <h3> Professional Goals</h3>
      <p> My professional and personal experiences are varied. I've tried my hand in many different fields. Through much exploration and trial and error,
        I have landed on a career in IT. I am drawn to the mixture of working with tech, problem solving, and just fixing things. I know
        the work will be intellectually stimliating and challenging, and I know that there will be opportunities for growth. I have spent
        much of 2023 studying IT, and it has been rewarding. I will be attending Western Governors University, and my goal is to complete
        a Bachelor's in IT by next summer.</p>
       <p>As I grow in the field, I will have a better idea of how to specialize. What appeals to me most at this point is working with databases.
        To that end, I plan to complete trainings and courses centered on SQL, PowerBI, and more. I will also study for the CCNA, Security+, and LPIC
        Certificatons.
       </p>  
       
       <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
       <p>I am committed to personal growth and artistic expression. In particliar, I have focused on singing. I've taken classical singing lessons
        and have become a much better singer. Recently, I have made great strides in creating my own music and arrangements. Over the next year, 
        I hope to write an album's worth of songs. I also hope to find inspiration to write poetry. I used to be great at it (I even won an award
        from my university's literary journal)

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>First Aid Attendant & Labourer  <em>09/2021 - Present</em></p>
          <p> I received a Level 3 First Aid certificate in Sep 2021. I have worked at factories and construction sites across the lower mainland. 
              This work has been greatly rewarding. I trliy enjoy helping people when they are hurt, and when they come to me for care, even 
              for minor injuries. As a labourer, I do the grunt work like: moving equipment and tools, cleaning the worksite, digging in the dirt,
              and other tasks as needed. Some of the more interesting things I did were concrete mixing, light carpentry, using Bondo, and getting 
              my hands on some power tools.

          <p>Concierge <em>08/2020 - 07/2021</em></p>
          <p> I worked at the front desk for a 400+ unit strata. I was the first point of contact for anything and everything 
            that went on in the building. Some of the major duties were: entrance and egress security, coordinating move-in and move-outs, 
            collecting fees and fines, parking enforcement, patrols, package reception, and coordinating maintenance work with
            elevator techs, cleaning staff, and plumbers. </p>
