        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>First Aid Attendant & Labourer  <em>09/2021 - Present</em></p>
          <p> I received a Level 3 First Aid certificate in Sep 2021. I have worked at factories and construction sites across the lower mainland. 
              This work has been greatly rewarding. I truly enjoy helping people when they are hurt, and when they come to me for care, even 
              for minor injuries. As a labourer, I do the grunt work like: moving equipment and tools, cleaning the worksite, digging in the dirt,
              and other tasks as needed. Some of the more interesting things I did were concrete mixing, light carpentry, using Bondo, and getting 
              my hands on some power tools.
          </p>

          <p>Concierge <em>08/2020 - 07/2021</em></p>
          <p> I worked at the front desk for a 400+ unit strata. I was the first point of contact for anything and everything 
            that went on in the building. Some of the major duties were: entrance and egress security, coordinating move-in and move-outs, 
            collecting fees and fines, parking enforcement, patrols, package reception, and coordinating maintenance work with
            elevator techs, cleaning staff, and plumbers. </p>
